This is my current running Marlin Firmware for the MendelMax 3.  My machine was upgraded from a MendelMax 2 and therefore uses single start lead screws.  This is a much newer version of Marlin meaning it has more features and is more reliable.  I also added support for gcode M242 commands to control the LEDs, something only partially implemented in the version of Marlin provided by Makers Tool Works.  Compiles perfectly in Arduino 1.8.1
